Media Browser 3 Server - TWiT.tv Channel Plugin
===============================================

Please note, this fork is unmaintained, although it's code does mostly work to parse the TWiT network XML feeds. Instead I've started writing an integration using the TWiT API. More info here: https://github.com/thedrjones/TwitNetwork


This plugin allows the retrieval and viewing of the latest TWiT.tv netcast feeds.
